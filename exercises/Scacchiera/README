A simple exercise that uses some nice features of Qt, such as:
- QGraphicsScene::drawBackground() to draw the chessboard
- QGraphicsScene::mouseMoveEvent to catch mouse motion on the bomb
- QPixmapItem to draw the bomb image
- Button handling( toggling, enabling/disabling )
- Using of connect() and disconnect()
